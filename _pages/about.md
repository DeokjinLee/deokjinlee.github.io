Hello, I’m Deokjin Lee, a Ph.D. student in the Motion Control Lab at DGIST, Korea, supervised by Prof. Sehoon Oh.

My research focuses on advancing humanoid robotics beyond human physical capabilities. I’ve developed a human-like dual-arm robot and am working on optimal controller design to maximize performance.

I'm particularly interested in physically aware, data-driven optimization for control design in flexible joint robots, integrating model-based and data-driven methods with system identification techniques.
