Dual-Arm Robots · System Identification · Model-Based & Data-Driven Control · Physically informed Optimization


Hello, I’m Deokjin Lee, a Ph.D. student at the Motion Control Lab, DGIST, Korea, under the supervision of Prof. Sehoon Oh.

My research focuses on advancing humanoid robotics to exceed the limits of human capability. I have developed a human-like dual-arm robot and am currently working on designing optimal controllers to push the boundaries of control performance.

My current interests lie in data-driven optimization of control design for flexible joint robots, with a particular focus on enhancing physical awareness through system identification and hybrid control strategies.
